# Sudoku-Solver
Python script to solve sudoku. Uses recursive backtracking. 

Write down the sudoku matrix in a file named "sudoku_problem.txt", which should be located in the same folder where the script is.
Enter 0 for blank spaces and each number should be separated by a space and each row by a newline.

Check the example included in case any confusion arises.
